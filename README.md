# Perculator

Here is a Monte-Carlo simulator, which models colored hadron strings, interacting at high energies in hadron colliders (LHC, FAIR, NICA, etc). The name "perculator" stands for PERColation calcULATOR, where percolation (more precisely, percolation transition) is a physical phenomenon of an abnormally rapid change of some parameters at relatively slow changes of other parameters, which the former are depending on.

This software may be useful in the exploration of the colored string model, since it exploits a continuous area of a cross section, unlike all previous simulators created for this purpose.

The master branch contains a complete working version of simulator, capable of calculating the nn and ptpt correlation coefficients. 

The readme will be complemented... The software, undoubtedly, needs to be revised, since there is much work to do regarding optimisation and refactoring.
